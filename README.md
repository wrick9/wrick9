- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @wrick9

Way way back in the day, I taught myself programming in Basic then Z80 on the ZX Spectrum.  I wrote one game (Riptoff) and since then have planned to do a rewrite of a BBC Micro game called "Labyrinth".

I've done quite a bit so that will be my first project - I have versions of the source files all over the place and I can't remember which is the latest.  Hopefuuly this'll help.
